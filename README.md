# Paige Keenan - Personal Portfolio
This is the code base of my personal portfolio. It's evolved a lot over the years. My work is a product of what is the best product *right now*, what is the best technology I can learn and should build this in? Right now it's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) because this seems like a fun project to really learn within and master it. Who knows what it will be written in a year from now. Navigate to the ```archive``` directory to see my old sites and what code practices were trending a year ago.
